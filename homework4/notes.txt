In order to run a shell on client and the mitm respectivelly:

    docker exec -it client /bin/sh 
    docker exec -it mitm /bin/sh 

Set MITM as default gateway on client (can use DNAT on the real default gateway to route traffic through MITM):
    ip route del
    ip route add default via <mitm-IP> dev eth0 

Run on host to get name of container network interface:
    docker exec -it <container-name> cat /sys/class/net/eth0/iflink # place value in grep
    ip ad | grep <obtained-value>

Enable ip forwarding for IPv4 on MITM:
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Enable NAT on MITM:
    iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

Route the traffic to the Queue on MITM:
    iptables -D FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 1



Exercise 2
----------
First byte (Byte 0) of TLS Record Protocol is higher TLS protocol (22 is HANDSHAKE where ClientHello is done).
Fourth and fifth bytes (Bytes 3 and 4) are length of data (exluding the header itself).

    Handshake Protocol format (higher layer stacked after record layer (record layer only 5 bytes))

    First byte is type (Client Hello is 1). Next 3 bytes are handshake message length.

    Handshake message start with 2 bytes for TLS version, then 32 bytes for random number,
    then comes 1 byte for session IDs length. Then each session ID, the size of one should be 4 bytes.
    After that comes CipherSuites (first 2 bytes are length and each 2 next bytes are for 1 cipherId).
    TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA - 0x0035.
    This cipher suite should be replaced with
    TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA - 0x002F.
